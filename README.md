# Boeing-Stock-Prediction-A-comparative-Study
In the dynamic realm of financial markets, the ability to predict stock prices remains a coveted yet challenging endeavour. Traders, investors, and researchers alike have sought to harness the power of advanced technologies and machine learning algorithms to gain insights into the intricate patterns of stock movements. Among the myriad of approaches, the combination of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Random Forest has emerged as a compelling strategy for stock prediction.<br><br>
This project is divided into three parts each focussed on different algorithms. For this analysis, Boeing stock is chosen as the focal point of the stock prediction project. As since the past two decades, the Boeing company has been through a lot of developments and changes due to its reputation as the Aerospace giant. From introduction to the 737-Max aircrafts with highest ever peaks in stock market to the crashes, the Boeing company has been into a steady turmoil recently.<br><br>
By applying the intricate capabilities of LSTM, XGBoost, and Random Forest, the aim is to unravel the historical patterns and trends specific to Boeing's stock performance. This comprehensive exploration will delve into the dynamics of Boeing's stock movements, leveraging the strengths of each algorithm to provide nuanced insights. Through this focused approach, the endeavour is to enhance the understanding of the factors influencing Boeing's stock prices and contribute to the broader discourse on effective stock prediction methodologies in the financial domain.
